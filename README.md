## âœ… Requirements

- Laravel `7.0` or newer
- PHP `7.2` or newer

## ðŸ”Œ Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require nevadskiy/laravel-position
````

## ðŸ”¨ Add positions to models

Add the `HasPosition` trait to your models that should have positions:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Nevadskiy\Position\HasPosition;

class Category extends Model
{
    use HasPosition;
}
```

Add a `position` column to the model tables:

```php
Schema::create('categories', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->integer('position')->unsigned()->index();
});
```

That is all.

## ðŸ“„ Documentation

### How it works

Models have an `integer` attribute named position that indicates their `position` in the sequence. This attribute is automatically calculated upon insertion and is utilized for sorting the models during query operations.

### Creating models

The `position` attribute is a kind of array index and is automatically inserted when a new model is created:

```php
$category = Category::create();
echo $category->position; // 0

$category = Category::create();
echo $category->position; // 1

$category = Category::create();
echo $category->position; // 2
```

#### Default ordering

By default, the newly created model is assigned the position at the end of the sequence. The first record in the sequence is assigned a position value of `0`. That behavior is configured by the `getNextPosition` method:

```php
public function getNextPosition(): int
{
    return -1;
}
```

The negative positions can be used to calculate position from the end of the sequence and `-1` is almost identical to this: `static::count() - 1`.

#### Reverse ordering

If you want to create models in reverse order, you can specify the next position of the model to be `0`:

```php
public function getNextPosition(): int
{
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a new model will be created at the beginning of the sequence. The position of other models in the sequence will be **automatically** updated:

```php
$first = Category::create();
echo $first->position; // 0

$second = Category::create();
echo $second->position; // 0
echo $first->position; // 1 (automatically updated)

$third = Category::create();
echo $third->position; // 0
echo $second->position; // 1 (automatically updated)
echo $first->position; // 2 (automatically updated again)
```

### Deleting models

When a model is deleted, the positions of other records in the sequence are updated automatically.

### Querying models 

To select models in the arranged sequence, use the `orderByPosition` scope:

```php
Category::orderByPosition()->get();
```

### Automatic ordering

The `orderByPosition` scope is not applied by default because the corresponding SQL statement will be added to all queries, even where it is not required.

It is much easier to manually add the scope in all places where you need it.

However, if you want to enable auto-ordering for all query operations, you can override the `alwaysOrderByPosition` method in your model like this:

```php
public function alwaysOrderByPosition(): bool
{
    return true;
}
```

### Moving items

#### Update

To move a model to an arbitrary position in the sequence, you can simply update its position like this:

```php
$category->update([
    'position' => 3
]);
```

The positions of other models will be automatically recalculated as well.

#### Move

You can also use the `move` method that sets a new position value and updates the model immediately:

```php
$category->move(3);
```

If you want to move the model to the end of the sequence, you can use a negative position value:

```php
$category->move(-1); // Move to the end
```

#### Swap

The `swap` method swaps the position of two models.

```php
$category->swap($anotherCategory);
```

#### Without shifting

By default, the position of other models are automatically shifted when the model position is updated.

If you want to change the model position without shifting the position of other models, you can use the `withoutShifting` method:

```php
Category::withoutShifting(function () {
    $category->move(5);
})
```

#### Arrange models

It is also possible to arrange models by their IDs.

The position of each model will be recalculated according to the index of its ID in the given array. 

You can also provide a second argument as a starting position.

```php
Category::arrangeByKeys([3, 5, 7]);
```

### Grouping / Dealing with relations

To allow models to be positioned within groups, you need to override the `newPositionQuery` method that should return a query to the grouped model sequence.

Using the relation builder:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
use Nevadskiy\Position\HasPosition;

class Category
{
    use HasPosition;

    public function group(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Group::class);
    }

    protected function newPositionQuery(): Builder
    {
        return $this->group->categories();
    }
}
```

Using the `where` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

protected function newPositionQuery(): Builder
{
    return $this->newQuery()->where('parent_id', $this->parent_id);
}
```
