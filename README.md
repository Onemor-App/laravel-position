    $table->integer('position')->unsigned()->index();
});

## ðŸ“„ Documentation

### Description

Models have a 'position' field with an unsigned integer value that is used for their ordering.

The position field serves as a sort of array index and is automatically inserted when creating a new record. 

By default, the model takes a position at the very end of the sequence.
