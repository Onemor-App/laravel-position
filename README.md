ðŸ”¢ Arrange Laravel models in a given order.

## âœ… Requirements

- Laravel `7.0` or newer
- PHP `7.2` or newer

## ðŸ”Œ Installation

Install the package via composer.

```bash
composer require nevadskiy/laravel-position
````

## ðŸ”¨ Add positions to models

Add the `HasPosition` trait to your models that should have positions.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Nevadskiy\Position\HasPosition;

class Category extends Model
{
    use HasPosition;
}
```

Add a `position` column to the model tables.

```php
Schema::create('categories', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->integer('position')->unsigned()->index();
});
```

## ðŸ“„ Documentation

### How it works

Models simply have an integer `position' attribute corresponding to the model's position in the sequence, which is automatically calculated on write and used for sorting the models on reads.

### Creating models

The `position' attribute is a kind of array index and is automatically inserted when a new model is created.

The starting position gets a `0` value by default. To change that, override the `startPosition` method in the model:

```php
public function startPosition(): int
{
    return 0;
}
```

By default, the created model takes a position at the very end of the sequence. If you need to customize that behaviour, you can override the `nextPosition` method:

```php
public function nextPosition(): ?int
{
    return $this->startPosition();
}
```

In that example, a new model will be created in the beginning of the sequence.

### Deleting models

When a model is deleted, the positions of other records in the sequence are updated automatically.

### Querying models 

To select models in the arranged sequence, use the `orderByPosition` scope.

```php
Category::orderByPosition()->get();
```

### Auto ordering

The `orderByPosition` scope is not applied by default because the corresponding SQL statement will be added to all queries, even where it is not required.

It is much easier to manually add the scope in all places where you need it.

However, if you want to enable auto-ordering, you can override the `alwaysOrderByPosition` method in your model like this:

```php
public function alwaysOrderByPosition(): bool
{
    return true;
}
```

### Moving items

#### Update

To move a model to an arbitrary position in the sequence, you can simply update its position like this:

```php
$category->update([
    'position' => 3
]);
```

The positions of other models will be automatically recalculated as well.

#### Shift / Move

You can also use the `shift method that sets a new position value and updates the model immediately:

```php
$category->shift(3);
```

#### Swap

The `swap` method swaps the position of two models.

```php
$category->swap($anotherCategory);
```

#### Without shifting

By default, the package automatically updates position of other models when the model position is updated. 

[//]: # (TODO:)

```php
Category::withoutShifting(function () {
    // @todo
})
```

#### Arrange

It is also possible to arrange models by their IDs.

The position of each model will be recalculated according to the index of its ID in the given array. 

You can also provide a second argument as a starting position of the records.

```php
Category::arrangeByKeys([3, 5, 7]);
```

### Grouping / Dealing with relations

To allow models to be positioned within groups, you need to override the `newPositionQuery` method that should return a query to the grouped model sequence:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

protected function newPositionQuery(): Builder
{
    return $this->category->tasks();
}
```

Example with self-referenced groups:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

protected function newPositionQuery(): Builder
{
    return $this->newQuery()->where('parent_id', $this->parent_id);
}
```
